## :computer: About

This project focuses on creating a 2D game called "so_long". The objective of this project is to gain a better understanding of fundamental concepts such as graphics rendering with sprites, 2D game mechanics, and file parsing.


## :space_invader: Features
- [x] :earth_americas: Map parsing and error handling
- [x] :video_game: Basic 2D game mechanics
- [x] ðŸŒŠ: Flood Fill algorithm
- [x] :memo: Graphcs rendering using Minilibx
- [x] :moneybag: Player movement using key bindings, collectibles, and exit, that activates after coins are collected
- [x] :checkered_flag: Counter to track the player moves


## ðŸ†˜: Maps and error checking

For example, the map for the rendered game above looks like this.Â 

- 0 = ground

- 1 = wall

- C = collectible

- P = player starting position

- E = exit

Map checking tests that all collectibles and the exitÂ are reachable with a flood-fill -algorithm. Other checks are for example thatÂ there is only one player and one exit, the game area is surrounded by walls, and no extra characters on the map.
